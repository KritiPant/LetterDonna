<h1>Donna❤️</h1>
<p>Dearest Donna chan,</p>
Words cant describe how much you mean to me. It was already surreal to have you. But you made me realize so many minute things that will probably help me grow and become a better person. You are the most kind hearted and sweetest person out there.Your presence has a joyful effect which just seeps in every person you meet. My heart and blood warms like a sunflower under the sun, whenever I think of you. I didn’t know I longed for a friend like you until i got to live with you these wonderful past two nights that we spent together. From past few years I have been living under the shadow of my own social anxiety. I was getting so used to the solitude that it was making me really very isolated from the world that ‘is’.  I was Slowly making myself disconnected from the world, which was sort of creating this pang of loneliness which I thought I liked ! But You came and reminded me that friends and people is all we have got. It is through these extraordinarily ordinary relationships that we can actually know ourselves better. It is through these precious connections that we are able to experience the wonder that is life ! It’s like you swam your way in with a magical hand of yours and pulled me out of my own deep dark waters.
You made me realize that we can always give to people in our own little ways and make them happy, and that it is really not very hard to do. You just have to acknowledge the person and you have played your part ! I was always too anxious to make people happy and comfortable around me, i thought it was hard. But you made me realize that it is otherwise. I am extremely shy when it comes to expressing emotions. I am used to express them in my own isolation. I become way too conscious to express something vulnerable about me to the other person. Conscious to the point that words doesn’t really come to my mouth, it is almost like it doesn’t want to land on my lips. But you made me realize, that I am conscious because I am way too worried about myself. If I give my whole loving attention to the person I will somehow be able to express myself.
When you were opening up to me, and sharing some parts of your life with me, I realized I forgot myself, hence I forgot my anxiety. And I could give my whole loving attention to you. Thats all we need to do. Give our whole loving attention and things fall right in to there place on their own.
I am so glad that in this majestically infinite timeline of a universe we have saved the collection of such great memories. We will always be there living those two nights laughing, reminiscing, longing, and most importantly ‘feeling’ together. I am so grateful to the universe that I met you.
Sending so much love, happiness and joy towards you… ❤️
THANK YOU SO MUCH, for your cutest lil amazing gifts ever. Best thing any one has ever done for me. Not sure if I deserve such love, but I am so deeply thankful. Gratitudes.
Please know, I will always be here thinking about you in good spirits.</p>
